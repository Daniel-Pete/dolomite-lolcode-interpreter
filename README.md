Welcome to Dolomite: LOLCODE interpreter. This was developed by the Group Dolomite in fulfillment of their CMSC 124 requirements. The members are Daniel Aguilar, Steven Crespo, and Ged Malabanan from section T-8L under Ma'am Erika Cunanan and Ma'am Bernadette Pelaez.

# Dependencies
This program requires the latest version of Python installed. It is also recommended to run the program in
Windows to avoid issues with Tkinter (which has compatibility issues with macOS).


# Building 

In order to build the analyser using the terminal, you must first clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Pete/CMSC124-Project.git`

Once you have downloaded the repository, navigate into the following directory:

<code>
cd CMSC124-Project
</code>

You are now ready to run the interpreter. If you are using **Windows**, type the command below in order to run the interpreter:

`python UI.py`

If you're using **macOS** or **Linux**, you are required to run the interpreter using the latest version of Python. Running in previous versions may result into an error. Run the interpreter using the command below:

`python3 UI.py`
